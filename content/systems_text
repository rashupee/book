Physics is a scientific way to think about, discuss, and predict things that happen in nature.

What is nature?
	The concept of nature in the context of physics is very different from how the word nature is commonly used outside of physics. Outside of physics one might say 


It might seem like physics is a language

????????
Maybe the title of this chapter ought to be Introduction to Physics with a section that is highlighted as important called Systems????
????????

Here is a way to start by speaking personally to the student:

When people learn that I teach physics, I often get a reaction that goes something like this:
	"Physics? That's just math, right?"

Another interesting statement that I hear comes from physicists and physics teachers:
	"Physics is a scientific way to think about the world"

Introduction to notion of system in physics outline:

Solar system example
	point out that not only are the objects important, also why the objects continue to stay together (or not) is important. What qualities do these particular objects possess that makes them form the system. Also, what is required to change the system or take the system apart.

	Physicists discover new physics, new natural laws and phenomena, by carefully inspecting a chosen system and seeing how they may cause it to change.

	How to inspect the system scientifically? How to share the results of their experiments?

PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

One of the most helpful concepts for learning and doing physics is the organizational idea of a PHYSICAL SYSTEM. The reason why it is so helpful is that it gives a person a definite context in which to explore issues and share results with other scientists.

Actually, many different disciplines, scientific and non-scientific, use the idea of a system. Since we are studying physics, though, we are going to explore scientific physical systems. Physics does not generally apply in non-scientific or non-physical systems but it almost always has a little something to say.

An example to get us started is our solar system.

You likely have at least heard of our solar system. In some poetic sense the solar system is our planet earth's neighborhood in the universe. *** LINK TO QUICK VIDEO OR IMAGE OR BOTH *** Perhaps you've even studied it in an earlier science class.

Astronomers use telescopes and other technologies to observe and catalog the objects that comprise our solar system and they've been doing this for a long time in human history. The following is a PARTIAL list of the objects that comprise the physical system known as our SOLAR SYSTEM:

	Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

It turns out this is an incomplete list. For example, what about Earth's single moon? What about all the big an little objects that make up Saturn's rings? Did you know that ?????? Neptune ?????? has more than one moon?  

INTERNAL OBJECTS

A physicist studies nature by observing the phenomena of systems. It is the physicist that determines what system they want to study- they are the ones to list out the important objects. In the solar system example, a physicist may try out the following list as representative enough 


EXTERNAL OBJECTS

It is one thing to list the objects of a system. It is another to separately list other objects that are not considered part of the system. In our solar system example, all the other billions and billions (and billions and ...) of stars and the planets and moons and other matter that surround them in the universe are considered external to our solar system.

All of these objects that are not considered part of our solar system are said to be EXTERNAL to the system. For example, the star Betelgeuse is an external object to our solar system. We could also say that these external objects comprise the environment of a system.

INTERNAL OBJECTS
In contrast, for example, our moon is considered an INTERNAL OBJECT of the solar system. Another internal object to our solar system is your body. In fact, we may identify your body as an internal object to a SUB-SYSTEM of the solar system called Earth!

Our solar system is obviously not the only physical system that we can study. What are some other physical systems? Your answers will depend on what you tend to notice and are interested in. Different people take note of different things. Actually, any thing or set of things is a physical system.

	The earth (atmosphere, hydrosphere, and terrasphere) is a physical system.
	The earth and the moon is a physical system. The earth and moon when the moon is over the Pacific Ocean is a physical system. The earth and moon when the moon is over the Atlantic Ocean is the same physical system but at a different time.
	A human being is a physical system.
	25 cars stuck in traffic is a physical system.
	1 car is a physical system.
	A mug and the hot coffee within it are a physical system. The same coffee and mug but later when the coffee is colder. The same coffee and mug but after they have been dropped and the mug shattered and the coffee scattered is still the SAME physical system.
	A refrigerator, the cold food within, and the electric company that powers the refrigerator is a physical system.
	A hammer hitting a nail into wood in a garage is a physical system.

The way physicists often work is they notice an interesting or unexpected phenomenon. Then they think through what are the important objects and separate out and identify the interesting physical system. The physical system they choose to study tends to be as simple as possible while still containing the interesting phenomenon. 

In some cases a physicist may experiment with the system in as many different ways they can think of (and can pay for!), all the while recording how the system reacts to what the scientists are doing. In other cases the scientist may just observe the system in as many different ways they can think of, carefully recording how all of the internal and external parts of the system interact with each other.  **** THIS IS VAGUE AND PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE ****




Systems as tools

Systems we do not have control over

Systems we can force to exist and have control over

Systems evolve in time

Where is personality or preference in a physical system? Really hard to address but the position of this text is as follows: something like personality in a human or a cat is a very high level quality of an especially complicated physical system and not yet 'fully explainable' by physics. BUT, that doesn't mean that one cannot use physics to explore an issue like personality




********************  START OVER  ***********************

A very important organizational idea in this introduction to physics is the idea of a PHYSICAL SYSTEM.

I'm sure you've heard of many different systems-
	1. our solar system;
	2. ecosystem;
	3. computer system;
	4. nervous system;
	5. circulatory system;
	6. a country's Justice System;
	7. a country's education system;
	8. a region's system of roads and highways;
	9. a person's system for doing their taxes.

The systems that someone will have experiences with are likely systems associated with their work or their natural interests. A law student will, of course, be interested in f. But this law student may also conceivably be interested in all of the others except maybe a. 

Since this book is about physics, though, you are going to learn to explore a very particular type of system that we'll refer to as a PHYSICAL SYSTEM. In fact, the best way to summarize your learning goals at this introductory level is:

	You will learn concepts, principles, and laws of physics
	You will EXPLORE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS with these concepts, principles, and laws

The way physicists often work is they notice an interesting or unexpected physical phenomenon. Then they think through what are the important objects and separate out and identify the interesting physical system. The physical system they choose to study tends to be as simple as possible while still feasably exhibiting the interesting phenomenon.

In some cases a physicist is able to construct a physical system and then experiment with the system in as many different ways they can think of (and can pay for!), all the while recording how their system reacts to what the scientists are doing.

In other cases the scientist may just observe the system in as many different ways they can think of, carefully recording how all of the internal and external parts of the system interact with each other.  **** THIS IS VAGUE AND PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE ****
