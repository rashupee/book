Physics is a scientific way to think about, discuss, and predict things that happen in nature.

What is nature?
	The concept of nature in the context of physics is very different from how the word nature is commonly used outside of physics. Outside of physics one might say 


It might seem like physics is a language

????????
Maybe the title of this chapter ought to be Introduction to Physics with a section that is highlighted as important called Systems????
????????

Here is a way to start by speaking personally to the student:

When people learn that I teach physics, I often get a reaction that goes something like this:
	"Physics? That's just math, right?"

Another interesting statement that I hear comes from physicists and physics teachers:
	"Physics is a scientific way to think about the world"

Solar system example
	point out that not only are the objects important, also why the objects continue to stay together (or not) is important. What qualities do these particular objects possess that makes them form the system. Also, what is required to change the system or take the system apart.

	Physicists discover new physics, new natural laws and phenomena, by carefully inspecting a chosen system and seeing how they may cause it to change.

	How to inspect the system scientifically? How to share the results of their experiments?

PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

One of the most helpful concepts for learning and doing physics is the organizational idea of a PHYSICAL SYSTEM. The reason why it is so helpful is that it gives a person a definite context in which to explore issues and share results with other scientists.

Actually, many different disciplines, scientific and non-scientific, use the idea of a system. Since we are studying physics, though, we are going to explore scientific physical systems. Physics does not generally apply in non-scientific or non-physical systems but it almost always has a little something to say.

An example to get us started is our solar system.

You likely have at least heard of our solar system. In some poetic sense the solar system is our planet earth's neighborhood in the universe. *** LINK TO QUICK VIDEO OR IMAGE OR BOTH *** Perhaps you've even studied it in an earlier science class.

Astronomers use telescopes and other technologies to observe and catalog the objects that comprise our solar system and they've been doing this for a long time in human history. The following is a PARTIAL list of the objects that comprise the physical system known as our SOLAR SYSTEM:

	Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

It turns out this is an incomplete list. For example, what about Earth's single moon? What about all the big and little objects that make up Saturn's rings? Did you know that ?????? Neptune ?????? has more than one moon?  

INTERNAL OBJECTS

A physicist studies nature by observing the phenomena of systems. It is the physicist that determines what system they want to study- they are the ones to list out the important objects. In the solar system example, a physicist may try out the following list as representative enough 


EXTERNAL OBJECTS

It is one thing to list the objects of a system. It is another to separately list other objects that are not considered part of the system. In our solar system example, all the other billions and billions (and billions and ...) of stars and the planets and moons and other matter that surround them in the universe are considered external to our solar system.

All of these objects that are not considered part of our solar system are said to be EXTERNAL to the system. For example, the star Betelgeuse is an external object to our solar system. We could also say that these external objects comprise the environment of a system.

INTERNAL OBJECTS
In contrast, for example, our moon is considered an INTERNAL OBJECT of the solar system. Another internal object to our solar system is your body. In fact, we may identify your body as an internal object to a SUB-SYSTEM of the solar system called Earth!

Our solar system is obviously not the only physical system that we can study. What are some other physical systems? Your answers will depend on what you tend to notice and are interested in. Different people take note of different things. Actually, any thing or set of things is a physical system.

	The earth (atmosphere, hydrosphere, and terrasphere) is a physical system.
	The earth and the moon is a physical system. The earth and moon when the moon is over the Pacific Ocean is a physical system. The earth and moon when the moon is over the Atlantic Ocean is the same physical system but at a different time.
	A human being is a physical system.
	25 cars stuck in traffic is a physical system.
	1 car is a physical system.
	A mug and the hot coffee within it are a physical system. The same coffee and mug but later when the coffee is colder. The same coffee and mug but after they have been dropped and the mug shattered and the coffee scattered is still the SAME physical system.
	A refrigerator, the cold food within, and the electric company that powers the refrigerator is a physical system.
	A hammer hitting a nail into wood in a garage is a physical system.

The way physicists often work is they notice an interesting or unexpected phenomenon. Then they think through what are the important objects and separate out and identify the interesting physical system. The physical system they choose to study tends to be as simple as possible while still containing the interesting phenomenon. 

In some cases a physicist may experiment with the system in as many different ways they can think of (and can pay for!), all the while recording how the system reacts to what the scientists are doing. In other cases the scientist may just observe the system in as many different ways they can think of, carefully recording how all of the internal and external parts of the system interact with each other.  **** THIS IS VAGUE AND PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE ****




Systems as tools

Systems we do not have control over

Systems we can force to exist and have control over

Systems evolve in time

Where is personality or preference in a physical system? Really hard to address but the position of this text is as follows: something like personality in a human or a cat is a very high level quality of an especially complicated physical system and not yet 'fully explainable' by physics. BUT, that doesn't mean that one cannot use physics to explore an issue like personality




********************  START OVER  ***********************

A very important organizational idea in this introduction to physics is the idea of a PHYSICAL SYSTEM.

I'm sure you've heard of many different systems-
	1. our solar system;
	2. ecosystem;
	3. computer system;
	4. nervous system;
	5. circulatory system;
	6. a country's Justice System;
	7. a country's education system;
	8. a region's system of roads and highways;
	9. a person's system for doing their taxes.

The systems that someone will have experiences with are likely systems associated with their work or their natural curiosities. A law student will, of course, be interested in number 6. But this law student may also conceivably be interested in many of the others.

Since this book is about physics, though, you are going to learn to explore a very particular type of system that we'll refer to as a PHYSICAL SYSTEM. In fact, the best way to summarize your learning goals at this introductory level is:

	You will learn concepts, principles, and laws of physics
	You will EXPLORE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS with these concepts, principles, and laws

The way physicists often work is they notice an interesting or unexpected physical phenomenon. Then they think through what are the important objects and separate out and identify the interesting physical system. The physical system they choose to study tends to be as simple as possible while still feasably exhibiting the interesting phenomenon.

In some cases a physicist is able to construct a physical system and then experiment with the system in as many different ways they can think of (and can pay for!), all the while recording how their system reacts to what the scientists are doing.

In other cases the scientist may just observe the system in as many different ways they can think of, carefully recording how all of the internal and external parts of the system interact with each other.  **** THIS IS VAGUE AND PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE **** For example, a scientist cannot mock up a solar system and then do experiments on it. 




*********************  Another do-over *********************


An important organizational idea in both learning and doing physics is the PHYSICAL SYSTEM. A very basic example of this is our Earth - Moon system.

EARTH - MOON System Example
	
	Our planet and our moon seem to be 'stuck' to each other. You know that our planet earth is on a trajectory or orbit around our sun. It takes a year for the earth to travel once around the sun in its orbit before starting the trip over again. But if you think about it, earth's moon is always along for the ride.

	In fact, instead of saying that the earth goes around the sun in 365 days, it turns out that it's better to say: 'The earth - moon system takes a year to go around the sun.'

	Let's realize some more data about the Earth - Moon system example above. The moon takes about 28 days to complete its orbit around the earth. This is where the basic quantity of time called the 'month' comes from. That is, both the motion of the earth - moon system around the sun and the motion of the moon around the earth are PERIODIC. That is, the motions repeat (365 days for earth - moon system to finish one trip around the sun; 28 days for the moon to finish one trip around the earth).

	Another basic thing to realize is that as we talk and think and conceptualize about the various objects involved (Earth, Moon, Sun, in the above example), we can imagine these things as entities by themselves. That is, we can imagine the moon without thinking about the earth or the sun. And we can imagine the earth without thinking about the sun or the moon. Of course conditions on the earth or moon would be very different without the sun nearby, but these objects in our physical system can be thought of as separate and each could be imagined as existing even if the others did not.

	So the physicist doesn't just think about systems of objects, but the physicist also imagines that they can think about the object on its own.

INTERNAL OBJECTS, EXTERNAL OBJECTS, INTERACTION

	In the above Earth - Moon System example, the physical system is just two objects: the earth and the moon. We say that the Earth and the Moon are INTERNAL OBJECTS to that physical system. In contrast, our Sun is considered an EXTERNAL OBJECT to the Earth - Moon System.

	I'm sure that you've heard this before but part of the reason the Earth and Moon are 'stuck' to each other is gravity. Gravity is the INTERACTION between the Earth and the Moon in the Earth - Moon system. If there was no gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon, there is no reason for the Earth and Moon to be stuck to each other. Gravity does not just happen between the earth and moon but actually happens between any pair of objects. So gravity happens between you and the earth (this is called your weight), between the earth and the sun, between the sun and you, between the sun and the moon, etc. In fact, gravity happens between any thing and any other thing in the universe. We will talk more about gravity in another section of this text.

	Gravity is not the only type of interaction objects can have with each other. 

DEFINITION OF A PHYSICAL SYSTEM

	In order to define a physical system a scientist lists out the objects within the system and also identifies or imagines how those objects interact.

	The Earth - Moon System would be described this way:

		Earth - Moon System
			INTERNAL OBJECTS:
				Earth
				Moon

			EXTERNAL OBJECTS:
				Everything else in the universe :)

			INTERACTION:
				Gravitational attraction between any pair of objects

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

	A heavy iron bolt is removed from a hot oven and gently placed in 1 Liter of cold water. What happens is the warm bolt warms the cold water and the cold water cools the warm bolt until the bolt and water have the same temperature.

	Let's claim the following physical system:
		INTERNAL OBJECTS:
			Bolt
			Water

		EXTERNAL OBJECTS:
			Everything else in the universe

		INTERACTION:
			Heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects until there are no longer differences in temperature



	**** NOTES *****
		not periodic!
		Objects can be fluid
		what if we further included some air or the container?
		why didn't we include the temperature? 




ANOTHER EXAMPLE

	You know that things are made of atoms and there are many different types of atoms with different names. Some types of atoms include oxygen, hydrogen, uranium, gold, and iron. Let's think about the heavy iron bolt in the previous example.

	An iron bolt made of pure iron is composed of a VERY LARGE number of individual iron atoms. Since we are imagining pure iron, there are no other types of atoms in this iron bolt. And these individual iron atoms are 'stuck' to their neighbors by so-called metallic bonds.

	So, really, our iron bolt is itself a physical system of iron atoms. We could DEFINE an iron bolt physical system this way:

		Iron Bolt System
			INTERNAL OBJECTS:
				A very large number of iron atoms

			EXTERNAL OBJECTS:
				Everything else in the universe

			INTERACTION:


	The truth is, though, that a large sample of pure iron is VERY uncommon. For example, an iron bolt that helps to hold a bridge together is likely to have a coating of rust. Rust is when oxygen and hydrogen atoms are mixed in with iron atoms and the process of the rusting of iron is called oxidation.
