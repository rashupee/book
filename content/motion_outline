Introduction
	Acknowledgement that people know that things move. But go ahead and introduce special situations of motion.
		slow, fast, large changes, slow changes, cycling, periodicity, interesting motion in gravity, fluids flow, electric currents, information

	Motivations to be precise (scientific)
		characterizing and quantifying motion- important to be precise.

	The concepts are:
		background / inertial reference frame / map / first effort at modelling (spatial model of the space and the objects in it)
			versus point of view
			non-inertial frames

		translating / different directions / different distances 

		keeping track of time / clock time vs durations

		vector

		moving / speeding up / slowing down / changing direction

		velocity 

		acceleration

		instantaneous / average

		Difficult topic-
			Helpful language could be 'at this moment the motion is changing from ... to ...' or 'during this time duration the motion only has one value and does not change'

			the motion of an object IS THE SAME AS the instantaneous velocity of an object. If the velocity of an object is changing, the object's motion is changing. If the velocity is not changing then the object's motion is constant.

				going around in a circle. is this a constant motion? NO









What's the difference between being stopped and stopping?
