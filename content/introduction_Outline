This book is a very different introduction to physics from the usual thing. It's probably more like the book How Things Work but I think I am still different from that book. I should check out the book Matter and Interactions (is mathy) so I can make sure that I am still making something original enough.


Physics is the most successful scientific conceptualization and language that humans have developed for exploring, recording, communicating, and understanding basic phenomena in nature. Let's unpack this.....





Not much math but there is some math
	Some actual addition, multiplication, allusions to processes with math like integration although it'll be mentioned only in passing and conceptually

	Mostly a very conceptual description of the mathematical structures that calculations depend on

Goal is to make the schedule of the material very approachable because for the most part I expect people to know something(or at least heard about these things) about some of the deeper basic truths in science-
	stuff is made out of particles like atoms and electrons
	the universe is big and has some organization

	that's about it for what I expect other than a basic way of reading and assimilating new ideas

For instructors I want to supply basic puzzle pieces that mostly are independent from each other. ??? MEDIA ??? Some interesting questions that require teachers to read individual and grouped student responses
