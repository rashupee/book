Multiple choice questions that are dynamic in time!!!!!




Modern Physics
	absorption of light by gas of atoms
		white light goes through gas and is prismed. You will see colors removed. What if you prism the white light before the gas will colors be removed? If so, are the removed wavelengths the same or different? If not, why not?


Systems
	Exploration:
	What other objects are considered members our solar system? Can you find reliable sources of information that include discovery dates, descriptions of the objects, and stories about the scientists involved? Where do the names of the objects come from?

	Describe the context of your search and then summarize your discoveries in a note to a friend or family member who is not taking physics with you. Be sure to include a description of your sources so that your recipient could find your resources in their own researches.


	Exploration:
	List out four physical systems that you can see from where you are right now. And then use your imagination to think of four physical systems that you cannot see right now but know exist somewhere.

	For each of the eight of your physical systems, describe an external object to the system. And also describe an object that is in a sub-system of your system.

	Here is an example so you can get the flow:
		A car outside in the parking lot is a physical system. External to this system is another car parked nearby.
		An internal object of this system is one of the car's wheels. If I call this wheel a sub-system of the car, an object in this subsystem is the pressurized air in that wheel.


Motion
	Match a dynamic speedometer with the developing motion in a simulation.
