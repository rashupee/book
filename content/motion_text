**Acknowledge that things move

You already know that things can move and you already know how to use language to describe a lot about motion. For examples, read the following descriptions of cars and see if you can pick out how and what important details are conveyed with words and numbers.

1. A white car is not moving. This white car is AT REST
2. Cars move fast along a highway.
3. Cars move fast towards the north along a highway. Some move the opposite direction: south. Some cars are faster than others.
4. A red car travels north with a speed of 70 miles per hour (70 mph or 70 mi/hr).
5. A blue car is moving faster than a red car.
6. A green car runs a red light at 20 mi/hr without slowing down or speeding up.
7. A yellow car slows from 20 mi/hr to 10 mi/hr during a 2 second interval while it travels north through a stop sign. Then it speeds back up from 10 mi/hr to 45 mi/hr during a 5 second interval. This all happens while travelling north.
8. An orange car is travelling north on a highway at 60 mi/hr and enters a gentle curve in the highway. This car carefully maintains its 60 mi/hr speed through the turn and after the turn the car is now going west at the same 60 mi/hr speed.
9. A purple car is travelling north on a highway at 80 mi/hr and enters a gentle curve in a highway. It slows from 80 mi/hr to 65 mi/hr and then speeds back up to 80 mi/hr as it exits the curve. The purple car is now moving west at 80 mi/hr.



It may be obvious but it is also important to point out that an object's motion can be changing. We're going to call this acceleration. If an object is accelerating, its motion is changing. If an object is not accelerating, its motion is not changing. Here is a story that describes a particular car's motion at different times: 

**Acknowledge that we'd like to see what is the relationship between things we do and their effects. We need / can be precise about these efforts if we precisely define how we can talk about AND measure details about motion.

One of the most basic things that happens in nature is that things move. Sometimes big things move slow but sometimes they move fast. It seems like if one pushes on an object like a book on a table, it will move faster if they push harder.
