**Acknowledge that things move

You already know that things can move and you already know how to use language to describe a lot about motion. Cars move fast down a highway and some cars are faster than others. But cars also move slow when they are on city streets or in traffic. Sometimes cars don't have motion- they may be parked in a parking lot or stopped at a stop sign. We say, in these cases, that our object, the car, is at rest.

It may be obvious but it is also important to point out that an object's motion can change. Here is a story that describes a particular car's motion at different times: 

**Acknowledge that we'd like to see what is the relationship between things we do and their effects. We need / can be precise about these efforts if we precisely define how we can talk about AND measure details about motion.

One of the most basic things that happens in nature is that things move. Sometimes big things move slow but sometimes they move fast. It seems like if one pushes on an object like a book on a table, it will move faster if they push harder.
