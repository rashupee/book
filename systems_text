Physics is a scientific way to think about, discuss, and predict things that happen in nature.

What is nature?
	The concept of nature in the context of physics is very different from how the word nature is commonly used outside of physics. Outside of physics one might say 


It might seem like physics is a language

????????
Maybe the title of this chapter ought to be Introduction to Physics with a section that is highlighted as important called Systems????
????????

Here is a way to start by speaking personally to the student:

When people learn that I teach physics, I often get a reaction that goes something like this:
	"Physics? That's just math, right?"

Another interesting statement that I hear comes from physicists and physics teachers:
	"Physics is a scientific way to think about the world"

Introduction to notion of system in physics outline:

Solar system example
	point out that not only are the objects important, also why the objects continue to stay together (or not) is important. What qualities do these particular objects possess that makes them form the system. Also, what is required to change the system or take the system apart.

	Physicists discover new physics, new natural laws and phenomena, by carefully inspecting a chosen system and seeing how they may cause it to change.

	How to inspect the system scientifically? How to share the results of their experiments?

PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

One of the most helpful concepts for learning and doing physics is the organizational idea of a PHYSICAL SYSTEM. The reason why it is so helpful is that it gives a person a definite context in which to explore issues and share results with other scientists.

Actually, many different disciplines, scientific and non-scientific, use the idea of a system. Since we are studying physics, though, we are going to explore physical systems. Physics does not generally apply in non-physical systems.

An example to get us started is our solar system.

You likely have at least heard of our solar system. Perhaps you've even studied it in an earlier science class. 
Astronomers use telescopes and other technologies to observe and catalog the objects that comprise our solar system. Here are a few of the objects that comprise our solar system: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. It turns out this is an incomplete list. For example, what about Earth's moon? What about Saturn's rings?

	Exploration:
	What other objects are considered members our solar system? Can you find reliable sources of information that include discovery dates, descriptions of the objects, and stories about the scientists involved? Where do the names of the objects come from?

	Describe the context of your search and then summarize your discoveries in a note to a friend or family member who is not taking physics with you. Be sure to include a description of your sources so that your recipient could find your resources in their own researches.

It is one thing to list the objects of a system. It is another to separately list other objects that are not considered part of the system. In our solar system example, all the other billions and billions (and billions and ...) of stars and the planets and moons and other matter that surround them in the universe are considered external to our solar system.

All of these objects that are not considered part of our solar system are said to be EXTERNAL to the system. For example, the star Betelgeuse is an external object to our solar system. We could also say that these external objects comprise the environment of a system.

In contrast, for example, our moon is considered an INTERNAL OBJECT of the solar system. Another internal object to our solar system is your body. In fact, we may identify your body as an internal object to a SUB-SYSTEM of the solar system called Earth!

Our solar system is obviously not the only physical system that we can study. What are some other physical systems? Your answers will depend on what you tend to notice and are interested in. Different people take note of different things. Actually, any thing or set of things is a physical system.

	The earth (atmosphere, hydrosphere, and terrasphere) is a physical system.
	A human being is a physical system.
	25 cars stuck in traffic is a physical system.
	A mug and the hot coffee in it are a physical system.
	A refrigerator, the cold food within, and the electric company that powers the refrigerator is a physical system.
	A hammer hitting a nail into wood in a garage is a physical system.

	Exploration:
	List out four physical systems that you can see from where you are right now. And then use your imagination to think of four physical systems that you cannot see right now but know exist somewhere.

	For each of the eight of your physical systems, describe an external object to the system. And also describe an object that is in a sub-system of your system.

	Here is an example so you can get the flow:
		A car outside in the parking lot is a physical system. External to this system is another car parked nearby.
		An internal object of this system is one of the car's wheels. If I call this wheel a sub-system of the car, an object in this subsystem is the pressurized air in that wheel.

The way physicists often work is they notice an interesting or strange behavior happening somewhere in nature. Then they think through what are the important objects and identify the interesting physical system. The physical system they choose to study tends to be as simple as possible while still containing the interesting phenomenon. 

The physicist may then somehow interact with the system in as many different ways they can think of (and can pay for!), all the while recording how the system reacts to what the scientists are doing. Or the scientist may just observe the system in as many different ways they can think of, carefully recording how all of the internal and external parts of the system interact with each other.  **** THIS IS VAGUE AND PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITHOUT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE ****




Systems as tools

Systems we do not have control over

Systems we can force to exist and have control over

Systems evolve in time

Where is personality or preference in a physical system? Really hard to address but the position of this text is as follows: something like personality in a human or a cat is a very high level quality of an especially complicated physical system and not yet 'fully explainable' by physics. BUT, that doesn't mean that one cannot use physics to explore an issue like personality




********************  START OVER  ***********************

A very important organizational idea in this introduction to physics is the PHYSICAL SYSTEM.

I'm sure you've heard of many different systems- our solar system; ecosystem; computer system; nervous system; circulatory system; a country's Justice System; a country's education system; a region's system of roads and highways; a person's system for doing their taxes. The systems that you have experiences with are likely systems associated with your work or your natural interests.



Since this book is about physics, you are going to learn to explore a very particular type of system called a PHYSICAL SYSTEM. In fact, the best way to summarize your learning goal at this introductory level is:

	You will learn about concepts, principles, and laws of physics
	You will be able to EXPLORE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS with these concepts, principles, and laws
