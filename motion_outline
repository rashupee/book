Introduction
	characterizing and quantifying motion- important to be precise.

	The concepts are:
		background / inertial reference frame / map
			versus point of view
			non-inertial frames

		translating / different directions / different distances 

		keeping track of time / clock time vs durations

		vector

		moving / speeding up / slowing down / changing direction

		velocity 

		acceleration

		instantaneous / average

		the motion of an object IS THE SAME AS the instantaneous velocity of an object. If the velocity of an object is changing, the object's motion is changing. If the velocity is not changing then the object's motion is constant.

			going around in a circle. is this a constant motion? NO









What's the difference between being stopped and stopping?
